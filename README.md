## How to run automaticly (for linux users)

Here is a sample wich use cronjob for run every 2 hours and [notify by ProjectDiscovery](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/notify) to send result in our telegram bot
+ Make a bot in [botfather](https://t.me/BotFather) and get the API-KEY
+ Send a message to [getidsbot](https://t.me/getidsbot) and get your CHAT-ID
+ Get notify from [HERE](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/notify)
+ Add your target links in a txt file (E.x. links.txt)
+ Type this
```
crontab -e
```
+ In the end, you can send ChangeTower results on every social media. In this example we send our results with the telegram bot. (Edit the command below and add your API-KEY, CHAT-ID and etc)
```cron
* */2 * * * cat ~/links.txt | ChangeTower -s | notify -telegram -telegram-api-key 18620*****:AA*******tu-7qDyQUy7VcQs******5ZAPE -telegram-chat-id 1234567890
```
+ Now every 2 hours its give to ChangeTower and run ChangeTower without a banner to don't send it by notify and notify will send all `cat ~/links.txt | ChangeTower -s` result in the telegram bot to the CHAT-ID is given.
